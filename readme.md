# Robust Multi-Task Learning with Flexible Manifold Constraint

This respository is our implementation of 

[Rui Zhang, Hongyuan Zhang, and Xuelong Li, "Robust Multi-Task Learning with Flexible Manifold Constraint," *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, vol 43. no. 6, pp. 2150-2157, 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9134971).

In this paper, we **unify the formulations of two kinds of multi-task learning** (MTL) and then **introduce the flexible manifold to MTL**. The model (**FMC-MTL**) is therefore insensitive to noises. 


All codes are implemented in MATLAB. If you have any issues, please email:
